OVERVIEW
--
The Species Tree Builder creates Species Trees showing relationships
between user-provided and reference Genomes.  It also builds GenomeSet
objects containing the genomes in the tree.


VERSION:  0.0.7 (Released September 2017)
--
NEW FEATURES:
- none

UPDATED FEATURES / BUG FIXES:
- Combines species tree and genome set building into a single method,
  so that references are consistent between the two objects.
- Reduces default number of genomes in tree to 20, to avoid cluttering
  up user's workspace.
